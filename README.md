# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository!  
This project contains my solutions for the annual Advent of Code programming challenges.

## 🚀 What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a series of 25 daily programming puzzles released from December 1st to December 25th. It's a great way to practice algorithms, learn new programming languages, or just have fun solving challenges.

## 📁 Project Structure

The solutions are implemented in **Python** and organized by day.
